## Image to PDF Converter
This is a Python script that converts multiple image files into a single PDF document. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) built using the Tkinter library, allowing users to select the input images and specify the output PDF file.

## Prerequisites
Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

Python: The code is written in Python and requires Python to be installed on your system. You can download Python from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

tkinter: The tkinter library is used for creating the GUI. It is usually included with Python installations by default.

Pillow: The Pillow library (a fork of PIL) is used for image processing. You can install it using pip: pip install pillow

## Limitations
The script only supports the conversion of JPG, JPEG, and PNG image formats to PDF. Other formats are not supported.
The script assumes that all selected images have the same dimensions. Mixing images with different dimensions may lead to unexpected results.
